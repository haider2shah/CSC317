            About Me
        </h1>
        
        <p> I am an undergraduate student at San Francisco State University, majoring in Computer Science.
            In addition to my academic work, I am a Google-certified UX Design professional and hold certifications 
            from the Interaction Design Foundation in User Journey Mapping and Perception and Memory in HCI and UX. 
            I am particularly passionate about the intersection of design and technology, with a strong focus on 
            front-end development and user experience.</br>
            
            My career goal is to become a Front-End UX Engineer, a role that allows me to merge creative design with 
            functional implementation. I actively work on personal projects where I design interfaces in Figma and 
            develop them using React.js, sharpening both my aesthetic and technical skills. 
            Beyond technology, I am also a trained theatre actor, an experience that has strengthened my communication, 
            collaboration, and presentation abilities - qualities I bring to every project and team I work with.
